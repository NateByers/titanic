## Survival Probability Model

The probability of survival displayed in the plot is the output of an XGBoost
classification model. The model used the following variables to predict 
survival: pclass, sex, age, sibsp, fare. 

The accuracy and confusion matrix can be seen in the diagnostic output below.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
confusionMatrix(factor(round(test_pred)), 
                factor(titanic_test$survived), 
                mode = "everything")
```
