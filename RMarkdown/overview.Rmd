| The RMS Titanic sank on April 15, 1912. There were over | |![](../img/Titanic.jpg)|
| 2,200 passengers onboard and about 1,500 died. This     | |                       |
| site includes a data set with some information about    | |                       |
| 1,309 of those passengers. Each tab provides a tool for | |                       |
| visualizing the data set with the goal of understanding | |                       |
| survival.                                               | |                       |
|                                                         | |                       |
|- The __Data__ tab provides the dataset in tabular form. | |                       |
|                                                         | |                       |
|- The __Data Explorer__ tab allows the user to visualize | |                       |
|  survival among the passengers conditioned by           | |                       |
|  categorical and numeric variables.                     | |                       |
|                                                         | |                       |
|- The __Dashboard__ tab is a static overview of some     | |                       |
|  key variables for understanding survival.              | |                       |
|                                                         | |                       |
|- The __Prediction__ lets the user choose characteristics| |                       |
|  of a single passenger and see what the probability     | |                       |
|  of survival is, based on a machine learning algorithm. | |                       |
